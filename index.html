                        <p>
                            I am passionate for learning and teaching. I also enjoy traveling, walking my dog, and
                            socializing with friends and family.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've found very rewarding to leverage my teaching skills to train others outside the
                            classroom
                            and in business oriented environments.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Learning new languages also fascinates me! It is a pleasure to serve as an interpreter
                            specially
                            in schools and medical environments.
                            The favorite places that I've volunteered were Columbus and Seattle Literacy Councils. After
                            working with adults from Argentina and Mexico, I became interested in learning and later
                            teaching
                            Spanish to americans and English to immigrants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is so much more we can learn from people when we are able to communicate in their
                            native language!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When on vacation, I love going anywhere related to Disney! It is my desire to go to all of
                            the
                            Disney parks around the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the meantime, my family and I have been hooked on Disney cruises! If not traveling,
                            hiking
                            with family and friends, and reading a good book are my next favorite hobbies.
